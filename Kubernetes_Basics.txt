What is Kubernetes?
    -> Official Definition
    -> Problem-Solution Case Study
    -> Basic Architecture
        - Master-Slave
        - K8S processes
    -> Basic Concepts
    -> Example Configuration
--------------------------------------------
-> Open source container Orchestration tool
-> Developed by Google
-> Helps you manage containerized applications in different deployment environments.(Physical/cloud)

What problem does Kubernetes solve actually?
What are the tasks of an orchestration tool?

-> Trend from Monolith to Microservices
-> Increased usage of containers
-> Demand for a proper way of managing those hundreds of containers

What features do orchestration tools offer?
    -> High Availability or no downtime
    -> Scalability or high performance
    -> Disaster recovery -backup and restore


KUBERNETES BASIC ARCHITECTURE:
----------------------------------------------
    -> Atleast one master node
    -> Some Worker nodes in which one one kubelet process is running on it.
    -> Each worker has multiple docker containers of different applications deployed
        on it based on the workload.
    -> Worker node is the node where the actual work is happening.(It has most load as it is running the applications)
    -> On master nodes important K8s processes are running, necessary to run the cluster
        nodes properly.
        
        Master node  --> API Server --> UI          (Entry point to K*S cluster)
                                    --> API
                                    --> CLI
                                    --> Controller Manager         (Keeps track of whats happening in the cluster
                                    --> Scheduler                  (Responsible for scheduling containers on different nodes based
                                                                 on workload and server resource)
                                                                    ensure Pods placaement
                            
                                    --> etcd                       ( current state of node configurations)
                                                                      K8S backing key-value store
                                                                      
        Virtual Network --> enables those worker nodes and master nodes talk to each other.
                         creates one unified machine
